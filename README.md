This project is based on, but not taken directly upon, the tutorial by Web Dev Simplified: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz8x71BiGXg.
I took the design concept and fundamental elements from the tutorial and developed my own implementation.

Simple budget tracking app that allows users to track their expenses and place them into budget groups.  Budget Tracker is a full stack RESTful CRUD app that uses 0Auth authentication for app access and API security. It allows you to retrieve user expense information stored in a database (mocked in the current API) and create, edit, or delete user information using the web app page.  It also supports exporting current expenses into a downloadable CSV format.
