This project is based on, but not taken directly upon, the tutorial by Web Dev Simplified: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz8x71BiGXg.
I took the design concept and fundamental elements from the tutorial and developed my own implementation.

My Project Experience timeline.

Before beginning:
My idea is to use Web Dev Simplified's tutorial to learn more about custom hooks implementation and proper use of context.  After which, I want to develop CRUD functionality and allow for users to store budget/expense data on an encrypted database.
Furthermore, I plan to add csv import/export functionality to allow users to pull site data or push existing data.
